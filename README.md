This game was created as part of [Tom Looman's](https://www.tomlooman.com/) Unreal C++ course. The course is taught using UE4 but I opted to use UE5 instead to learn the most recent version of the engine. I created a game with a player character with three main abilities. These three abilities were implemented through my own version of Unreal's gameplay abilitiy system. Creating my own version from scratch allowed me to understand how the GAS system works at a bunch simpler level. This allows me the oppurtunity to return and add more abilities to this character much easier. I also learned the environment query system and utilized that to create plots where an enemy character was able to randomize its position and use the world as cover. The enemy character used behavior trees in order to determine what it should do next. It's capable of finding the player, attacking, hiding, and healing.
