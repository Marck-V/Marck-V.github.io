## Projects
- ### 3rd Person Action Game (Unreal Engine 5)
  This game was created as part of [Tom Looman's](https://www.tomlooman.com/) Unreal C++ course. I created a game with a player character with three main abilities. These three abilities were implemented through my own version of Unreal's gameplay abilitiy system. Creating my own version from scratch allowed me to understand how the GAS system works at a bunch simpler level. This also leaves the door open for to returm to this project and continue to create more abilities for this character much easier. I also learned the environment query system and utilized that to create plots where an enemy character was able to randomize its position and use the world as cover. The enemy character used behavior trees in order to determine what it should do text. It's capable of finding the player, attacking, hiding, and healing.
